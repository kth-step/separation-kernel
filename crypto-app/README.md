# A simple crypt o app
This is a simple crypto app that receives messages and either encrypts them or decrypts them with its own private key. The encryption used is AES in CBC mode, with a 128 bit key.

This app makes use of the AES encryption implementation of [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl). All files under the "wolfssl" directory are from the [wolfSSL](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl) repo, specifically as found in commit "802e3127c0455afd1d1b5f8d1eb72ab7ea09e80a".
