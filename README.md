# S3K - Simply Secure Separation Kernel

Simply Secure Separation Kernel (S3K) is a real-time separation kernel for embedded RISC-V applications. S3K aims to spatially and temporally isolate all partitions running on the RISC-V processor. S3K relies on RISC-V's PMP mechanism to isolate the partitions, no virtual memory is required.
